# QA at the Point
Welcome to the QA at the Point repo for working with Selenium using C# on .NET Core!

## Purpose
QA at the Point will have presentations and workshops that will require programming and diving deep into tools, libraries, and code. This repo will make it easy to pull down what you need so you are ready to go every month!

## Steps to Get Started
1. Clone the repo onto your machine
    - I recommend making a `QAP` or `DEV` folder, but clone it where it's easy to get to

2. Open the Solution in *VS CODE* or *VISUAL STUDIO*
    - .NET Core will work on Windows, Linux, or Mac!

3. Build the Solution
    - Resolve any errors (there shouldn't be any)
    - Make sure tests are discovered correctly in `Unit Tests Pad`/`Test Explorer`

4. That's it! You're ready to follow along :)

## Rules/Guidelines
You are more than welcome to use any code that you find here in your personal and/or professional projects. That's what this is all for! However, don't try pushing anything up to this repo. It won't work haha. If there is any feedback you'd like to give me, just reach out to me on Twitter or LinkedIn @CarlosKidman

This repo will continue changing and evolving as we continue to progress every month. Let me know if you'd like to collaborate so you too can help with empowering our awesome QA Community! Happy testing!
